## Welcome to JohnPM DevOps Page, I write anything that can be helpful in coming days, weeks, months or years.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/johnpm45/DevOps-Notes/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
